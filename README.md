# Enhancing the Existing Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction Models


## Project Aim


## Project Objectives


## Literature Review
**(ÜNLÜ, 2021):** Applied Bayesian Optimization as the fine-tuning method with SVM with different kernels, specifically Linear kernel, Polynomial kernel, Radial basis kernel, and Sigmoid function. 
**(Rahman & Kumar, 2020):** Achieved highest accuracy after used oversampling and adjustment in number of trees for Random Forest algorithm.
**(Miao & Wang, 2022):** Employed Gridsearch

## Key Features
- **Dataset:** The [predicting credit card customer segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-credit-card-customer-attrition-with-m) dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
